## Overview

### The challenge

Users are able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page. Changes in all interactive elements occur smoothly using animations and transition properties

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpack
- I also used linters (stylelint and ESLint) to improve the quality of the code.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - First of all, the resource was very helpful at the configuration stage of the project build, because errors from the webpack side constantly occurred
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/) -  CSS property values, various functions, and more, all from there
- [Medium](https://medium.com/) - I've learned some useful articles on CSS And React
- [Jaket Rent](https://jaketrent.com/) - Thanks to this guy for a large number of short posts in his block with solutions to various issues
- [xhtml](https://jaketrent.com/) - I learned about the styling of scrollbars from here.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - When other resources didn't help...

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the [Nimish Jain article](https://nimishjn.medium.com/toggle-theme-in-reactjs-4095dd35c69d) on changing the theme in React, I relied a lot on it when creating my implementation
